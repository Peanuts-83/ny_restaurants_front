# Ny Restaurants (front-end) - HUNGRR!!!

HUNGRR!!! is a single page application made with Angular 17. It's designed to give access to a map of Newyork City, where the user could find restaurants around him.

Some forms allow filtering and search for restaurant name, cuisine type, borough and other values.

Back-end part of this app is [NyRestaurantsAPI](https://github.com/Peanuts-83/ny_restaurants_api). The database used in this project is outdated, most restaurants references are no more valid values. For dev practice only, main purpose being to manage a full stack project with API definition, database managment and UI/UX development.

* UI interface with base map and base nav/filter form
* UX reactive form with logic (infiniteScroll component, search field incorporated)
* UI/UX map fine tuning (map marker, info display, rectangle map coords)
* UX form final fixes
* UI Homepage and animation
